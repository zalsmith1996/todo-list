## Todo List
Todo List project created while working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

## About
The Todo List provides a way for users to create, edit, and delete projects and tasks. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alongside webpack and npm. It also makes use of localStorage in order to save projects and tasks between browser sessions.

### Notes
There are areas within this project that could be improved, and one day I will revisit it and remake it with a different approach. With that being said, I intend to leave this as is in order to better compare any new approach in the future.
